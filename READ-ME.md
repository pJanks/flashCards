### Abstract

I was tasked with creating classes of objects that interact with each other in order to implement a game you can play in the console.



### Setup

Clone this repository down and change directory into the directory containing the files from this repository. Once you are in the directory run `node index.js` in your command line and the game should begin. You are ready to play!
